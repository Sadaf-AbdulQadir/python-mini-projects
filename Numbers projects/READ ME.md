## Project Overview
This repository contains three independent mini-projects/scripts related to number concepts:

### 1. Number Utility Program (play_with_numbers.py)
A menu-driven Python program that allows users to:
- Find n digits of π (Pi)
- Find n digits of e (Euler’s Number)
- Generate a Fibonacci series
- Find prime factors of a number
- Find the next prime number after a given number
#### Features
- Efficient prime and Fibonacci logic
- Input validation for numeric entries 
- Clean menu system for user interaction

### 2. Tile Cost Calculator (cost_of_tiling.py)
A utility to calculate the total cost of tiles needed to cover a floor based on floor and tile dimensions.
Includes input validation to ensure only positive numeric values.
#### Inputs:
- Floor width and height (in meters)
- Tile width and height (in meters)
- Cost per tile
#### Output:
    Floor area and tile area
    Total number of tiles required (rounded up)
    Total cost for all tiles


### 3. Mortgage Calculator (mortgage_calculator.py)

A script to calculate monthly, weekly or daily mortgage payments for a fixed-term loan.

#### Inputs:
- Principal amount (P)
- Annual interest rate (r) in %
- Loan term (in years)
- Compounding frequency)
    
  - Monthly (12×/year)
  - Weekly (52×/year)
  - Daily (365×/year)
#### Output:
    Periodic payment amount
    Total payment over loan term
    Total interest paid

------------------------

### Concepts Covered

Loops and conditional logic

Input validation and error handling

Mathematical operations and formulas

Compound interest and exponential growth

Function modularity and reusability

### Future Enhancements

- Add amortization schedule for mortgage breakdown 
- Support for different tile layouts or waste factor
- GUI interface using Tkinter or Streamlit
